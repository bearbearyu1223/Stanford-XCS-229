All this while the test cases have avoided the test data completely. Now that
you have convinced yourself that the model is working as expected (i.e, the
observations you made in the previous part matches what you learnt in class
about regularization), it is finally time to measure the model performance on
the test set. Once we measure the test set performance, we report it (whatever
value it may be), and NOT go back and refine the model any further.

Autograder test case |2c-1-basic| will train your model and then evaluate its performance on the test data for both the regularized and non-regularized training strategies.  Before running this test case, edit line 362 of |src-mnist/grader.py| to state |skip = False| (model plotting/training is disabled by default to run the auotgrader faster).

You should have accuracy close to 0.92870 without regularization, and 0.96760 with regularization.
Note: these accuracies assume you implement the code with the matrix dimensions as specified in
the comments, which is not the same way as specified in your code. Even if you do not have precisely these
numbers, you should observe good accuracy and better test accuracy with regularization.
